KillMobs AKA ClearLagg



TLDR: I made this for a small server i run and noticed that there wasn't really any "good" clear lagg systems so i just made one myself there isn't a config or anything like that but it is open source and if you want to change the times you can (literally just chatgpt it if you need to do) 

The KillMobs mod enhances your Minecraft experience by automatically cleaning up unwanted mobs and item entities in your world. Every 30 minutes, the mod will trigger a cleanup event, removing hostile and non-passive mobs (excluding special mobs like tamed animals, named entities, and bosses like the Wither and Ender Dragon) as well as discarded items that clutter your world. This ensures your game runs smoothly by preventing lag caused by excessive entities.

Additionally, the mod provides a 5-minute warning before each cleanup event, sending a countdown in chat to alert players, followed by a dramatic 5-4-3-2-1 countdown before the action occurs.

Whether you’re managing a large server or just want to keep your world clean, KillMobs helps maintain optimal performance while keeping things fun and engaging!
